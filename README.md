## `JSON server build`

this project is currently using json server as a test REST API service on local dev environment. 

npm install -g json-server

npm run server (to start server)

see (https://github.com/typicode/json-server#readme) for full documentation

## Axios 

Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase). On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.

- Make XMLHttpRequests from the browser
- Make http requests from node.js
- Supports the Promise API
- Intercept request and response
- Transform request and response data
- Cancel requests
- Automatic transforms for JSON data
- Client side support for protecting against XSRF

## `React Hooks`

- UseState
- UseEffect

### UseState Hook
Hook state is the new way of declaring a state in React app. Hook uses useState() functional component for setting and retrieving state. Let us understand Hook state with the following example.

``` 
import React, { useState } from 'react';  
function CountApp() {  
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"  
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  
  
  return (  
    <div>  
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>  
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>  
        Click me  
      </button>  
    </div>  
  );  
}  
export default CountApp; 
```
### UseEffect Hook
The Effect Hook allows us to perform side effects (an action) in the function components. It does not use components lifecycle methods which are available in class components. In other words, Effects Hooks are equivalent to componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), and componentWillUnmount() lifecycle methods.

Side effects have common features which the most web applications need to perform, such as:

- Updating the DOM,
- Fetching and consuming data from a server API,
- Setting up a subscription, etc.

```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';  
  
function CounterExample() {  
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  
  
  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:  
  useEffect(() => {  
    // Update the document title using the browser API  
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;  
  });  
  
  return (  
    <div>  
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>  
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>  
        Click me  
      </button>  
    </div>  
  );  
}  
export default CounterExample;  
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn add react-scripts` 

This will install the package into the app

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
